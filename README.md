# Microba Dev Test
Write a VueJS App with the below features:

Use https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/ API

List all breeds with a checkbox (displaying the number of sub-breeds under every top-level breed)
Max 2 breeds can be selected.



Show 10 images from the selected breed, if two breeds are selected show 10 images in total 5 from each breed.




Ability to remove images, once all images of a breed are removed that breed should be unselected in the list.



Write service to communicate to external API components to call service to get data.


User should be able to change the max number of images to be visible for the selected breed.


If the browser is closed and reloaded app should remember user preference.



Looking for breed list and breed images to be a separate component.



Optional if you would like to use typescript.
